Here is a comprehensive vulnerability and patch management and remediation policy that your enterprise must follow to reduce the risks of a data breach:

Vulnerability and Patch Management


Establish and maintain an up-to-date software inventory of all applications, hardware, and systems in the organization.

Review and prioritize all identified vulnerabilities based on their severity and the associated risk to the organization.

Create a timeline for patching each vulnerability as quickly as possible.

Identify any vulnerable systems that cannot be patched and develop alternate risk-reduction strategies.

Develop a plan for testing and validating the efficacy of any patch before fully deploying it.

Monitor for any new threats or vulnerabilities that may arise over time.

Document all patching, testing, and validation processes for future reference.


Remediation 


Immediately contain any active threat or vulnerability by restricting access or disabling any affected systems.

Analyze all data related to the threat or vulnerability to identify any potential damage.

Implement a plan to remediate any damage caused by the threat or vulnerability.

Develop a process for validating the success of the remediation.

Monitor for any new threats or vulnerabilities that may arise over time.

Document all remediation, testing, and validation processes for future reference.
